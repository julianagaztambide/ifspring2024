        <p><b>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></p>
        <p>My name is Juliana Gaztambide and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Communication Design</p>
        <p><b>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></p>
        <p>Since I am a ComDes major I am required to take this class as one of my major requirements.</p>
        <p><b>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></p>
        <p>I have no experience with any type of coding.</p>
        <p><b>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></p>
        <p>I hope to learn some of the basics of coding so I can hopefully apply it any time in the future at jobs or personal projects.</p>
        <p><b>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></p>
        <p>I think the biggest difference I expect to see is all about balancing learning how to code with this new language while simultaneously keeping up withthe actual design aspects of the work.</p>
        <p><b>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>A website I think exemplifies effective design is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> They have set up their website in a way that you can see everything that they offer on their front page without feeling too overwhelmed. They have also made it so everything on the website is fairly easy to locate and have nailed their algorithim and search bar.</p>
        <p><b>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>I think a website that exemplifies effective communication is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> Their agorithim adapts really quickly to whatever the user is searching for. So it is able to hyper-fixate on the user's current interest but the moment said user searches for something different, the website adapts itself to the user's new searches.</p>
        <p><b>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>I think a website that works well is <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> It's extremely effective, very collaborative friendly, and it is easy to find documents you may have lost track of. My favorite part of the website is that it is impossible to lose your progress because it saves your work even if you are not connected to the internet.</p>
