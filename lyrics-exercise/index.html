            <p>Mrs. Magic to and fro</p>
            <p>Please give me one last show</p>
            <p>Loosen my mind from within</p>
            <p>Before it starts to wear and thin</p>
            
            <p><span class="headers">[Chorus]</span></p>
            <p>I don't know</p>
            <p>I don't know what I'm doing here</p>
            <p> don't know</p>
            <p>I don't know what I'm doing here</p>

            <p>Mrs. Magic radio</p>
            <p>Give me one last chance to go</p>
            <p>Tell you what lurks deep inside</p>
            <p>Deep inside my battered mind</p>
            
            <p><span class="headers">[Chorus]</span></p>
            <p> don't know</p>
            <p> don't know what I'm doing here</p>
            <p>I don't know</p>
            <p>I don't know what I'm doing here</p>

            <p>Leaving me outside</p>
            <p>No, I can't get back in</p>
            <p>No, I can't get back in</p>
            <p>Leaving me outside</p>
            <p>No, I can't get back in</p>
            <p>No, I can't get back in, uhh</p>

            <p>Mrs. Magic to and fro</p>
            <p>Just let me be myself</p>
