            <p><a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/"">Taste of Home</a> </p>
                <p>What caught my attention about Taste of Home is its aesthetic and sleek design. The typeface and line elements featured on the website make for a very minimalist style that allows the images of the food to pop out and draw the eye in.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">All Recipes</a></p>
                <p>An aspect of the All Recipes website that I really enjoy is how they feature the rating of the recipes clearly under the title of each one. Maybe the visual design of this one in particular is not the best, but I really link how clearly labled everything is and some of the special features it includes. </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly</a></p>
                <p>What caught my attention about Yummly in particular is how its main page only has 2 main features. A "quiz" to personalize your experience on their site and then if you scroll down you will get basically an endless amount of recipes. But that being said, if you enter to one of the recipes you will find a lot more information about that recipe, its nutritional values, and at the bottom you will have an entire tab of related recipes. </p>
        <h2>Links to Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
            <p><a href="https://quizlet.com/latest">Quizlet</a></p>
                <p>My favorite thing about the Quizlet website are the icons designed specifically for this website. The usercan tell that each of the illustrations were designed specifically for Quizlet's use, creating this brand recognition and a very solid and clear aesthetic.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a></p>
                <p> Canva is one of the classic design websites for people of all design experiences. What I enjoy so much about the website is that no matter if you are a complete beginner or a experienced designer, you can get something out of Canva. Its simple and clear website design and structure makes it very user friendly.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a></p>
                <p>I really like the Awwwards website as a great way to look at some experimental design and inspiration. The website itself features its best website submissions and creates an easy way for consumers to access said websites and experience them for themselves</p>
